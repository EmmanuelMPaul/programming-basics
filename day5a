(1) COMPILER (Language Translators continuation)
- A Compiler translates the whole source program into object code at once, and then executes it in Machine language code. 

- The process of translating a program written in a High-level source language into Machine language using a compiler is called Compilation.

Functions of a Compiler.
- Identifies the proper order of processing.

- Allocates space in memory for the storage locations defined in the program.

- Reads each line of the source program and converts it into Machine language.

- Checks for syntax errors in a program (i.e. statements which do not conform to the grammatical rules of the language).

- If there are no errors, it generates a listing of the machine code equivalent to the given program.

- Combines the Machine code generated with the appropriate subroutines.
