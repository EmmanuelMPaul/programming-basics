Day 4 (part one)
LANGUAGE TRANSLATORS
- Any program code written in either assembly or high-level language must first be translated into machine language, before the computer can recognize and run these programs.

- A Language Translator is a special software used to convert program statements written in Assembly languages or High-level languages into Machine code.

There are three types of language Translators:
	. Assembler 
	. Interpreter 
	. Compiler

Note. Interpreters and Compilers translate source programs written in High-level languages to their Machine language equivalents
