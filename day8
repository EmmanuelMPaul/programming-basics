(2) Features of Low-level languages.
 - They are machine hardware-oriented (i.e. they are machine based).
 - They are not portable.

(3) Advantages of Low-level languages
 - They can be easily understood by the CPU without or with little translation
 - The program instructions can be executed by the processor much faster

(4) Disadvantages of Low-level languages
 - They are difficult to learn, understand, and write 
 - They are machine-dependent, hence non-portable
