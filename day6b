Computer programs are usually developed in Modules or Subroutines (i.e. program segments designed to carry out the specific relevant tasks).  During program translation, these modules are translated separately into their Machine (object) code equivalents

(1) Linker
	- Linker is utility software that accepts the separately translated program modules as its input, and logically combines them into one logical module (known as the Load module) that contains all the required pieces for the translated program to be obeyed by the computer hardware.
(2) Loader
	- This is a utility program that transfers the linker output (i.e. the load module) into the computer memory, ready for it to be executed by the computer hardware.  
~ The linker takes input of object code generated by compiler/assembler and the loader takes input of executable files generated by linker
