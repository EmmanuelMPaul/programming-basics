(2) ASSEMBLER (Language Translators continuation)
- An Assembler translates programs written in Assembly language into Machine language (0's and 1's) that the computer can understand and execute.

Functions of an Assembler
- Checks whether the instructions written are valid.

- Identifies any errors in the program before translating, e.g. typing mistakes, using the wrong format for an instruction, etc

- Assigns memory locations to the names the programmer uses.

- If no errors are detected, it generates the Machine code equivalent of the Assembly instructions.

- Combines the Machine code generated with the appropriate subroutines.
