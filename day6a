Day 6 (part one)

Differences between a Compiler and an Interpreter
(1)
 - Interpreter translates and executes each statement of the source code one at a time.
 - Compiler translates all the source code statements at once as a unit into their corresponding object codes, before the computer can execute them.

(2)
 - Interpreter translates the program each time it is needed for execution; hence, it is slower than compiling.
 -Compiler compiled object codes can be saved on a storage media and run when required; hence they execute faster than interpreted programs

(3)
	- Compiler displays all errors after compilation, on the other hand, the Interpreter displays errors of each line one by one.

~ compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust.
~ interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python.
